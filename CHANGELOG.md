# Release Notes

The DID Auth SIOP typescript library is still in an beta state at this point. Please note that the interfaces might
still change a bit as the software still is in active development.

## 0.6.4 - 2024-04-24
- Fixed:
  - Success event was emitted even though presentation verification callback failed
  - Always verify nonces, extract them from VP
- Updated:
    - Update to latest @sphereon/ssi-types


## 0.6.3 - 2024-03-20
- Updated:
  - Update to latest @sphereon/ssi-types, including the latest @sd-jwt packages

## 0.6.2 - 2024-03-04

- Fixed:
  - RP kept stale options to create the request object, resulting in recreation of the same request object over and over

## 0.6.0 - 2024-02-29
- Added:
  - Initial support for SIOPv2 draft 11
  - Initial support for OID4VP draft 18
  - SD-JWT support
  - Partial support for http(s) client_ids instead of DIDs. No validation for keys in this case yet though!
  - Convert presentation submissions that inadvertently come in from external OPs as a string instead of an object
  - Allow id-token only handling
  - Allow vp-token only handling
  - EBSI support
- Fixed:
  - issue with determining whether a Presentation Definition reference has been used
  - vp_token handling and nonce management was incorrect in certain cases (for instance when no id token is used)
  - Make sure a presentation verification callback result throws an error if it does not verify
  - Do not put VP token in the id token as default for spec versions above v10 if no explicit location is provided
  - Several small fixes

## 0.4.2 - 2023-10-01

Fixed an issue with did:key resolution used in Veramo

- Fixed:
    - Fixed an issue with did:key resolution from Veramo. The driver requires a mediaType which according to the spec is
      optional. We now always set it as it doesn't hurt to begin with.

## 0.4.1 - 2023-10-01

Fixed not being able to configure the resolver for well-known DIDs

- Fixed:
    - Well-known DIDs did not use a configured DID resolver and thus always used the universal resolver, which has
      issues quite often.

## 0.4.0 - 2023-09-28

- Fixed:
    - Claims are not required in the auth request
    - State is not required in payloads
    - We didn't handle merging of verification options present on an object and passed in as argument nicely

- Updated:
    - Updated to another JSONPath implementation for improved security `@astronautlabs/jsonpath`
    - Better error handling and logging in the session manager
    - Allow for numbers in the scheme thus supporting openid4vp://

- Added:
    - Allow to pass additional claims as verified data in the authorization response. Which can be handy in case you
      want to extract data from a VP and pass that to the app that uses this library

## v0.3.1 - 2023-05-17

Bugfix release, fixing RPBuilder export and a client_id bug when not explicitly provided to the RP.

- Fixed:
    - Changed RPBuilder default export to a named export
    - Fix #54. The client_id took the whole registration object, instead of the client_id in case it was not provided
      explicitly
- Updated:
    - SSI-types have been updated to the latest version.

## v0.3.0 - 2023-04-30

This release contains many breaking changes. Sorry for these, but this library still is in active development, as
reflected by the major version still being 0.
A lot of code has been refactored. Now certain classes have state, instead of passing around objects between static
methods.

- Added:
    - Allow to restrict selecting VCs against Formats not communicated in a presentation definition. For instance useful
      for filtering against a OID4VP RP, which signals support for certain Formats, but uses a definition which does not
      include this information
    - Allow to restrict selecting VCs against DID methods not communicated in a presentation definition. For instance
      useful
      for filtering against a OID4VP RP, which signals support for certain DID methods, but uses a definition which does
      not
      include this information
    - Allow passing in submission data separately from a VP. Again useful in a OID4VP situation, where presentation
      submission objects can be transferred next to the VP instead if in the VP
    - A simple session/state manager for the RP side. This allows to find back definitions for responses coming back in.
      As this is a library the only implementation is an in memory implementation. It is left up to implementers to
      create their persistent implementations
    - Added support for new version of the spec
    - Support for JWT VC Presentation Profile
    - Support for DID domain linkage
- Removed:
    - Several dependencies have been removed or moved to development dependencies. Mainly the cryptographic libraries
      have
      been removed
- Changed:
    - Requests and responses now contain state and can be instantiated from scratch/options or from an actual payload
    - Schema's for AJV are now compiled at build time, instead of at runtime.
- Fixed:
    - JSON-LD contexts where not always fetched correctly (Github for instance)
    - Signature callback function was not always working after creating copies of data
    - React-native not playing nicely with AJV schema's
    - JWT VCs/VPs were not always handled correctly
    - Submission data contained several errors
    - Holder was sometimes missing from the VP
    - Too many other fixes to list

## v0.2.14 - 2022-10-27

## v0.2.11 - 2022-07-01

- Updated:
    - Update to PEX 1.1.2

- Fixed:
    - Revert back to commonjs

## v0.2.6 - 2022-02-10

      using external custodial signing with authn/authz
